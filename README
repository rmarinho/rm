<h2>the goal is to build a media server experience in html5 served from the raspberry pi</h2>

for now we are using and learning...

Node.js with modules:
    Express
    Jade
    Socket.IO
    FindIt
    

all this app is being coded using open source software and a running from raspberry_Pi
you can try to browse the last stable version if it's working at:

http://raspberrypi.ruimarinho.pt
    
EXAMPLES:

http://raspberrypi.ruimarinho.pt/files

Uses socket.io to update the ui with the results that are coming from findit.
Findit is finding folders in my nas.
